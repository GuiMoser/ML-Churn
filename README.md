# Machine Learning Improving F1 Score

Hyperparameter Tuning and Handling Class Imbalance.

This notebook performs an EDA on a churn dataset.

Then tests three types of classification models (DecisionTree, RandomForest, LogisticRegression) with different hyperparameters to choose the best one to solve the churn problem.

To handle with the classes imbalance, uses the oversmapling method, and the parameter class weight in the model. 

To finish, tune more hyperparameters in the model, to improve performance on the test set and increase the F1_Score.
